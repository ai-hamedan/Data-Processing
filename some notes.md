The dimensions (5,) and (1, 5) in Python represent different shapes of arrays. Let's break them down:

(5,):

This denotes a one-dimensional array (or vector) with 5 elements.

Example:

python
import numpy as np
array_1d = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(array_1d.shape)  # Output: (5,)
(1, 5):

This denotes a two-dimensional array with 1 row and 5 columns.

Example:

python
array_2d = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]])
print(array_2d.shape)
