# PCA works by first centering the data around its mean and then finding the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix. 
# The eigenvectors represent the directions of maximum variance, while the eigenvalues represent the amount of variance explained by each eigenvector.
# The eigenvectors are then used to project the data onto a lower-dimensional space.

# LDA works by first calculating the mean and covariance matrix for each class in the data. 
# It then calculates the between-class scatter matrix and the within-class scatter matrix.
# The goal is to find a projection that maximizes the ratio of the between-class scatter matrix to the within-class scatter matrix. 
# This projection is the linear discriminant function.

# One of the main differences is in their objectives. 
# PCA aims to find the directions of maximum variance in the data, while LDA aims to find the projection that best separates the classes in the data.

# Another difference is in their assumptions. 
# PCA is an unsupervised method that does not take into account the class labels in the data. 
# LDA, on the other hand, is a supervised method that assumes that the data is normally distributed and that the covariance matrices for each class are equal.

# Finally, PCA is often used for exploratory data analysis and preprocessing of data for machine learning algorithms, 
# while LDA is often used for classification and feature selection
